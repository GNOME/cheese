version 3.21.3
  - Ensure autogen works in non-srcdir builds
    Only the configure script should be run from the build directory; the
    rest of the ancillary tools that modify the sources and generate the
    configure script itself need to be run inside the source directory.
  - Use AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS
    DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS is for users and packagers to override
    distcheck options, while AM_DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS is for the
    maintainer of the software.

    https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#DISTCHECK_005fCONFIGURE_005fFLAGS
  - Explicitly mark the GSettings schema for intltool
    As recommended in the GSettings documentation.
  - Add gettext-domain the GSettings schema
  - Fix fallback application icon name
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765874
  - fileutil: implement translation of Webcam folder
    In this commit I added the feature that folder containing captured
    photos and videos has a name that suits the locale is used by system.

    The problem is that folder to save captured pics and videos has strict
    name "Webcam".

    To fix this problem I used gettext method.

  - Rename icon to match application namespace
    This is required in preparation for xdg-app.

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=761197
  - Drop udev dependency
    All that udev was used for is now covered by GstDeviceMonitor.
  - Add a missing tag to the AppData file
  - Update the AppData to spec version 0.7+
  - build-sys: Annotate we don't support srcdir != builddir from git
    Due to vala.
  - Fix resizing and scaling of video preview
    Allow the preview to expand, and set a reasonable minimum height and
    width.
  - Set a minimum effect actor size
    This allows the effects previews to expand with the size of the window.
  - Replace some stray references to ClutterTexture
    Fix rendering into effects previews, although the size of the previews
    is still incorrect.

  - libcheese: Fix warning on exit

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=754556
  - Support a default CheeseCamera device

    Accept a name, stash it inside the camera and then search through all
    the devices present on the system when setting up the camera. If a match
    is found, use it, otherwise continue to setup the first device.
  - Avoid crash when creating the default CheeseWidget

    Update the device argument to cheese_camera_new() to reflect the new use
    of GstDeviceMonitor, by renaming the device_node argument to name. Emit
    a critical warning if passing a name, as creating a device by name is
    not yet supported.

    and GstDeviceMonitor port.
  - libcheese: port to clutter-gst 3.0
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=743496
  - Fix documentation tests after GstDeviceMonitor
  - device-monitor: port to GstDeviceMonitor
    Use GstDeviceMonitor to monitor the GStreamer devices.
  - camera: avoid confusing error message
    Report about the name of the missing element instead of some other
    unrelated string.

version 3.17.1
  - Silence a gtk-doc undeclared symbol warning
    Split the typedef of CheeseVideoFormat out, so that gtk-doc does not
    report an undeclared symbol.
  - Use G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE where possible
  - icon: install symbolic to symbolic size
    rather than installing to scalable size, we install
    to symbolic due to the nominal size of 16x16
  - Provide a symbolic variant of the application icon
    Used for the High Contrast theme.
    The symbolic size has been introduced to hicolor to cope with
    the nominal size of 16x16 rather than the backward compatible
    128x128.

version 3.15.90
  - Avoid warnings from -Wswitch-enum
    Check switch statements where several cases are intentionally not
    handled by using an if instead.
  - Avoid a preprocessor warning
  - Fix const cast warnings
  - Fix signedness comparison error
  - Fix shadowed variable
  - Remove old-style function definitions
  - Fix signed comparison warning in camera service
  - Update gtkdoc_jh_path_xml_catalog.m4 from gtk-doc
  - Remove use of GSEAL_ENABLE
    It is no longer useful with GTK+ 3, where every widget has been sealed.
  - Remove use of GNOME_MAINTAINER_MODE_DEFINES
    https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeCommon/Migration
  - Drop use of gnome-autogen.sh
    https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeCommon/Migration
  - preferences: resolve ambiguous 'ListStore' usage
    There is now a GLib.ListStore as well, so make sure we use the full name
    Gtk.ListStore to avoid an ambiguous reference.
  - Added/Updated Translations
    - an, courtesy of Daniel Martinez

version 3.15.4
  - Ignore intermediate file with Automake 1.15
  - Removed obsolete variables in autogen.sh
  - um-crop-area: Fix deprecated API usage
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742530
  - um-crop-area: Enforce a minimum size
    Otherwise, if callers aren't careful, users could resize us so small
    that we'd crash inside gdk_pixbuf_scale() .
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742530
  - um-crop-area: Fix background rendering around the picture
    Instead of trying to fill the displayed pixbuf with the background
    color (and failing at that), just make the pixbuf be an aspect correct
    scaled size of the original picture and draw it at the correct offset
    on the draw vfunc.
    This allows us to get rid of deprecated gtk+ API usage and fixes the
    background around the picture ending up black despite de code's
    intent.
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742530

version 3.15.3
  - Refactor crop area scaling code
    Recently committed patch f9d576e was modified before applying it into
    the g-c-c to be more readable. This patch reflect those changes in cheese.

version 3.15.2
  - Fix Nepali desktop file keywords translation
  - Add name and summary elements to AppData
    Pacify appstream-util validate.
  - Limit default size for avatar cropping
    Commit c605ad3578ff66452bd7b01d257f31c64e7905ef enlarged default size
    for cropping avatars thus crop rectangle could be easily bigger then
    image. The crop rectagle can't be modified and cc_crop_area_get_picture
    causes errors if the rectangle is bigger, because it has negative
    coordinates. Limit the default size to fit the image also.

version 3.15.1
  - Substitute bindir and libexecdir in Makefile.am
    Rather than substituting the values of libexecdir and bindir during
    configure, which might include some unexpanded shell variables, expand
    and substitute them as targets in Makefile.am instead.

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726095
  - Use AC_PROG_SED in configure.ac
  - Remove old marshaller header from doc ignore list
  - Use get_instance_private() instead of priv pointer
    Use the generated macro rather than storing a pointer to the private
    struct within the object.
  - Drop some trailing semicolons after macros
  - Use new-style private struct in CheeseCameraDevice
  - Use _get_instance_private() consistently in camera
    Use the new cheese_camera_get_instance_private() instead of the old
    macro.
  - Bump required Vala version for get_menu_by_id()
    Use the get the given menu from GtkApplication.
  - Refactor setup_camera() in CheeseWidget
    Remove superfluous prototype. Use GSettings convenience getters. Reduce
    scope of some variables.
  - Avoid using G_GNUC_CONST on _get_type()
    As the g_type_ensure() documentation notes, it is incorrect to mark a
    _get_type() method with G_GNUC_CONST, as it as a side effect the first
    time it is called.
  - Use LT_LIB_M to find the math library
    libcheese-gtk needs to link with -lm to find the fmod function.
  - Avoid dereferencing an uninitialized variable
    Found with Coverity (CID 56653).

    Use halign on GtkWidget instead.
  - Avoid deprecated margin-left GtkWidget property
    Use margin-start instead.
  - Avoid GtkCellArea critical warnings in thumb view
    GTK+ switched from using constructor() to constructed() in GtkIconView,
    which exposed that Cheese does not chain up in the CheeseThumbView (a
    GtkIconView subclass) constructed() vfunc. Chain up at the start of
    constructed() so that the construct-only properties of the GtkIconView
    are set before calling icon view API.
  - Avoid using deprecated GtkAlignment

version 3.13.4
  - Track flash opacity explicitly
    Retrieving the opacity of the flash, reducing it by an exponentially
    small step, and setting it again does not always actually decrease the
    widget's opacity, and so the fading does not actually terminate.

    Incidentally, also unset the flash timeout tags to avoid calling
    g_source_remove() spuriously.

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=733433

    bar.

    Allow the application to be D-Bus activated by running with the
    --gapplication-service argument.
  - Remove old maintainers from DOAP file
  - Stop the running action when an error occurs
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=707386
  - Inhibit user switching and session idle
    As recording video from a webcam is undesirable when combined with
    switching users, inhibit switching and session idling.
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=694214

version 3.9.92
  - Close the preferences if the action is disabled
    When shooting, the preferences action is disabled. If the preferences
    dialog is shown, the resolution and capture device can still be changed,
    so hide the dialog when the preferences action is disabled.
  - Disable the preferences action while shooting
    Changing the resolution or camera device while recording can lead to a
    crash, so avoid the problem by disabling the preferences action whenever
    the mode change actions are disabled. Fixes bug 670782.
  - Fix video recording with GStreamer >= 1.1.4
    GStreamer >= 1.1.4 requires fully specifying the video-capture-source
    caps,
    otherwise Cheese prints this:

(cheese:22606): cheese-WARNING **: Filter caps do not completely specify
    the output format: gstcapsfilter.c(348): gst_capsfilter_prepare_buf ():

  - Improve cheese_camera_device_get_best_format()
    If a camera device which can do 1600x900 at 10 FPS and 1280x800 @ 25
    FPS, then 1600x900 is not really the best format, as 10 FPS leads to a
    bad user experience.

    Improve the situation by constraining
    cheese_camera_device_get_best_format() to return the format with the
    highest resolution with a width greater than 640 pixels and a framerate
    of greater the 15 FPS.

    If no mode matching the widh >= 640 && frame_rate >= 15 criteria is found,
    get_best_format will behave as before as simply return the highest
    resolution
    mode.

  - Limit caps to the maximum framerate
    Limit the caps returned by cheese_camera_device_get_caps_for_format() to
    the maximum framerate supported at the requested resolution. This is
    necessary because GStreamer first selects a format and then a framerate,
    resulting in it picking for 1280x720 as an example, YUYV @ 15 FPS,
    instead of MJPEG @ 30 FPS (which will be converted to i420 by the
    videoconvert element in camerabin2), or at 1600x1200 YUYV @ 5 fps
    instead of MJPEG @ 10 fps.

  - Move gettext initialization to main()
    Ensure that gettext is always initialized, regardless of whether the
    running instance is the primary instance.
  - Make actions insensitive when no webcam is present
    Set the "effects", "mode" and "shoot" actions insensitive when no camera
    devices are found on startup. Fixes bug 693070.
  - Remove TODO
  - Add touch event handler for selecting effects
    Use a ClutterTapAction on each effect to allow either a mouse click or a
    touch tap to select effects. Depend on Clutter 1.13.2 for
    ClutterTapAction. Fixes bug 692745.
  - Updated POTFILES.in and POTFILES.skip
  - Move action sensitivity handling to Application
  - Remove unnecessary instance_pos attribute
    The instance_pos attribute is only used in Cheese when connecting
    signals from actions to handlers with GtkBuilder.
  - Do not show thumbnails in fullscreen
    This can happen when toggling the wide mode action while fullscreen mode
    is active. Also remove the unnecessary resize calls.

    Signed-off-by: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>
  - Remove unused move_all_to_trash action
  - Remove wide-mode and fullscreen GSettings keys
    Both wide mode and fullscreen mode can be set with toggle actions, and
    there is little reason for the state to persist across application
    restart.
  - Mark cheese_[gtk_]init() arguments as allow-none
    It is reasonable to pass NULL for argc and argv.
  - Refactor command-line argument handling
    Only handle Cheese options on the command line; handle library options
    with environment variables instead. Use actions from the command-line
    parser to switch to wide mode and fullscreen mode.
  - Refactor Application startup
    Override default handlers rather than connecting to signals. Add
    startup() and use it to initialize cheese-gtk and gettext.
  - Split main() and Application into separate files
  - um-crop-area.c: Relicense to GPLv2+
    This makes the file fit in better with the rest of Cheese,
    license-wise.

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=703239
  - Remove stale help translations
    Many translations have not been updated since the switch to Mallard
    help, so remove them from HELP_LINGUAS to make the distribution smaller
    and speed up building.

  - Show an error message if the camera state is NULL
    If there is a GST_MESSAGE_ERROR, stop the stream and emit
    ::state-flags-changed on the CheeseCamera. Handle the state change in
    CheeseWindow by showing a generic error message. This message can easily
    occur if the video device is busy, such as when another application is
    using the webcam.

  - Fix being paused when effect valves are closed
    The move to autocluttersink in 3.9 causes a regression compared to 3.8,
    where if an effect's control valve is closed the pipeline will never
    transition from paused to playing since the cluttersink is stuck in
    paused.

    This regression can be triggered the following way:
    1) Go the effect selector
    2) Go to the next page in the effect selector, so that the now connected
    effects from the first page get their control valve set to closed
    3) Change resolution or device, so that the pipeline gets stopped and
    started again

    After 3) the pipeline will be stuck in pause, as the cluttersinks of the
    effect previews are stuck in pause.

    The cause for this is that with the move to autocluttersink we are no
    longer setting the sink's "async" property, see commit 424afdaa 'Use
    "autocluttersink" instead of "cluttersink"'.

    Setting the "async" property is no longer (easily) doable, since
    autocluttersink is a gstbin derived object which has the actual sink
    embedded.

    Instead this patch fixes the stuck in pause problem by locking the
    autocluttersinks of the effect previews into the playing state.

    Note that no longer setting of the async property on the sink is also
    the root cause of the issue fixed by my patch titled: "Set all valves
    open on play". The opening of the main valve is still necessary, since
    locking the viewfinder sink's state to PLAYING does not seem a good
    idea, the opening of the effects-valve on play OTOH is no longer
    necessary.

  - Use shoot action when handling the webcam button
    Rather then calling on_shoot directly, call the action, so that if shoot
    is disabled, it also cannot be triggered through the webcam button.

    Signed-off-by: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>
  - Set all valves open on play
    If some valves are closed on play, GStreamer will wait for the valves to
    open before moving from paused to playing, and a frozen image is shown.

    This does not happen on startup since on startup all valves are open,
    nor does it happen when changing video-format directly after startup,
    since all valves will still be open. As soon as
    cheese_camera_toggle_effects_pipeline() has been called once, any
    subsequent attempt to change the video format (and thus stopping and
    re-starting the pipeline) will result in a frozen image.

    This patch fixes this by opening all valves on play, and calling
    cheese_camera_toggle_effects_pipeline() with the last active value after
    the pipeline transitions to the playing state.

    This has the added advantage that unlike before the effects valve will
    be closed on startup, rather then staying open till the first call to
    cheese_camera_toggle_effects_pipeline().

version 3.9.3
  - Add documentation for CheeseCamera signals
  - Remove unused Cheese.MainWindow.get_data_file_dir
  - Make the flash background white
  - Fix assertion failures when taking a photo
    Before this patch, Cheese would log the following each time the user
    takes a photo:

    (cheese:21719): GLib-GIO-CRITICAL **: g_file_info_get_size: assertion
    `G_IS_FILE_INFO (info)' failed

    (cheese:21719): GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: g_object_unref: assertion
    `G_IS_OBJECT (object)' failed
  - Fix updating sensitivity of device selection combo
    If Cheese was started with 1 device, and then a second was added, the
    device selection stayed insensitive, making it impossible to select the
    second device.

    This fixes the problem, and also makes the combo insensitive again when
    going from >= 2 devices to <= 1 device.
  - Downscale image for effects-preview pipeline
    Having the whole effects-preview bin deal with ie 1280x800 images is not
    very useful, especially since even when fullscreen on a full-HD monitor,
    the preview images are smaller then 640xXXX. This useless high-res
    processing for 9 preview images in parallel brings my 2nd gen
    core i5 @ 3.1 GHz to its knees, resulting in a non fluid preview panel.

    Also after clicking through all effect preview pages, so that all effect
    preview textures are connected, cheese will use 1 GB of *resident* RAM
    with the example 1280x800 capture resolution.

    This patch improves this by downscaling the images from the video-source
    to 640xXXX where XXX is determined by the original resolution
    aspect-ratio.

    After this patch the effects preview framerate is much smoother, and the
    latency is noticably less. As a bonus the maximal resident size of
    Cheese in this example is reduced to 350 MB.
  - Do not block the main valve while recording
    Otherwise frames intended for the recording are dropped.
  - Only add videoconvert elements where necessary
    The "no effect" effect is our default value, and thus worth optimizing a
    bit. Clearly in the "no effect" effect case adding a videoconvert
    element both before and after the element is not needed.

    Note we also don't add the videoconvert elements when creating the
    initial pipeline, so this also keeps the way the pipeline looks
    initially and when "no-effect" is selected consistent.

    When starting Cheese with "no-effect" selected, this shaves off another
    130 ms of the initial pipeline creation time.
  - Drop unused preview_caps variable
  - Simplify returned GstCaps
    In cheese_camera_device_get_caps_for_format, simplify the returned caps.
    This results in much simpler caps, which as main advantage that they are
    way easier to read when trawling to debug logs.
  - Fix cheese_camera_device_get_best_format memleak
    cheese_camera_device_get_best_format() calls
    cheese_camera_device_get_format_list(), which returns a sorted copy of
    the format lists, then takes the first element of that list, and
    returns a copy of that element. While never freeing the list copy.

    This patch fixes this leak by simply making the priv->formats list
    sorted so that cheese_camera_device_get_best_format can use it directly
    without the need to make (and then later free) a copy.
  - Fix cheese_camera_device_filter_caps warning
  - Remove unused GstCameraBinFlags enum
  - Fix video-source memleak when switching cameras
  - Improve error handling in CheeseCamera
    Simplify error cleanup in cheese_camera_set_camera_source(). Do not call
    g_error_free() on a possible NULL error in
    cheese_camera_element_from_effect().
  - Fix no-video-after-switching-resolution problem
    There is a bug in wrappercamerabinsrc which causes it to lose its
    video-source setting after the pipeline has started, so on a
    stop/re-start, as when changing resolution, its video-source has become
    NULL, and there is no longer video.

    This patch works around this by moving the setting of the video-source
    property to cheese_camera_play(), so that it gets (re)set each time
    before starting the pipeline.

    I've also written a patch fixing the underlying cause, but since the
    workaround is simple, and has no adverse effects when the underlying
    issue is fixed, it seems a good idea to have this workaround in Cheese,
    see here for the gst-plugins-bad fix:

    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=701915
  - Remove extranous csp_post_balance element
    camerabin2 already has a videoconvert element both before and after its
    video-source-filter element, so ending the video-source-filter bin with
    a videoconvert element puts 2 videoconvert elements behind each other,
    which is not really useful.
  - Add a capsfilter to the video-source bin
    This serves 2 purposes. Firstly, it forces GStreamer to actually run the
    video source at the configured resolution, rather then say run it at
    1600x1200 @ 5 fps and downscale that to 800x600 (still at 5 fps), as
    GStreamer opts to do with my Logitech Webcam Pro 9000, when left to its
    own auto negotiate code. Secondly, by greatly reducing the amount of
    advertised caps (this cam supports lots of different resolutions at many
    different framerates per resolution), it avoids a caps intersect
    "explosion", reducing the pipeline caps negotiation.
  - Remove nautilus-sendto sharing support
    As nautilus-sendto can now only share by email, the sharing can be
    handled by a photo management application, or directy by the email
    client.
  - Avoid assert when taking avatar photos too quickly
    If the take photo button was pressed while a photo was being taken, an
    assert would be triggered by the failed call to
    cheese_camera_take_photo_pixbuf(). Avoid this by setting the take photo
    button insensitive while a photo is being taken, and setting it
    sensitive after the photo has been taken. Fixes bug 699596.

  - Fix UI string in avatar chooser test
  - Use AM_VALAFLAGS rather than VALAFLAGS
  - Avoid Vala warning about copying delegates
    Mark the variable in which CountdownCallback is stored as unowned, as it
    is simply a pointer to the callback.
  - Use "autocluttersink" instead of "cluttersink"
  - Use clutter_actor_set_background_color
    Instead of the deprecated cltuter_stage_set_color, use
    clutter_actor_set_background_color.
  - Use clutter_actor_add_child
    Instead of using the deprecated clutter_container_add_actor, use
    clutter_actor_add_child.
  - Avoid deprecated clutter_actor_animate
    Use implicit animation instead.
  - Avoid deprecated clutter_table_layout_set_expand
    Use the "expand-x" and "expand-y" properties on ClutterActor instead
    (which are both set to false by default).
  - Use ClutterActor rather than ClutterRectangle
  - User ClutterActor rather than ClutterBox
    ClutterBox is deprecated.
  - Bump required versions of Clutter and GIO
    GIO 2.32 or above is required for GMenu support and Clutter 1.12 is
    required to make use of new API to avoid deprecation warnings when using
    Clutter 1.12 or above.
  - Avoid Vala compiler warning about implicit begin
  - Fix cheese_thumb_view_new() prototype
  - Remove some unnecessary "static" keywords
    This avoids some warnings from the Vala compiler.
  - Update burst mode help page
    Improve the wording, add more details about the preference dialog.
  - Update the gschema to use "photo" and "image"
    Use "photo" and "image" instead of "picture" so that the schema
    descriptions are more consistent and precise.
  - Improve "Fire Flash" string in the Preferences
    Change "Fire Flash" to "Fire flash" because it is not a title, so should
    not use header capitalisation.
  - Fix typos in help
  - Update help for 3.8
    Mark author emails as not translatable. Correct "version" to
    "pkgversion" in revision tags. Update instructions for app menu and new
    preference dialog tabs. Stub mode-wide.page because the instructions are
    wrong.
  - Replace GtkBox casts with GtkGrid casts
    This manifested as the "Leave Fullscreen" button not being displayed
    when switching into fullscreen mode. Fixed bug 691454.
  - libcheese doesn't need gnome-desktop

  - More g_thread_init() removal
    Add --target-glib 2.32 to the VALAFLAGS so that we don't get
    g_thread_init() in the generated .c code.
  - Drop calls to g_thread_init() in tests
    Our dependency on Gtk 3.4 already gives us an indirect dependency on a
    GLib that no longer requires these calls.

    We got away with this for a while due to gstreamer's public dependency
    on libgthread, but as of bug 689043 gstreamer no longer does this so we
    now get link errors.

    cheese_camera_get_recorded_time() rather than a const empty string. The
    returned NULL can be safely freed with g_free(), whereas freeing the
    const string is undefined and leads to a crash with glibc.

  - Rename camerabin2 to camerabin
    camerabin2 was renamed to camerabin in GStreamer 1.0.
  - Depend on gstreamer-1.0
  - Do not set filter-caps property on camerabin2
    The "filter-caps" property doesn't exist on camerabin2.
  - Re-add GstCaps variable in CheeseCamera
    caps variable was removed during rebase, but it is still used.
  - Fix CheeseCamera recording time reporting
    Camerabin2 maintains its pipeline clock continuously running, this makes
    the time reporting for video recording actually report the time since
    camerabin2 was initialized.

    This patch fixes it by querying the video filesink for the correct
    recording time.
  - Check for camerabin2 instead of camerabin
  - Encode WebM/VP8 instead of OGG/Theora
    Create WebM profile and use it with camereabin2. Also use presets for
    vp8enc.
  - Stop-capture is asynchronous in camerabin2
    Wait for video-done message to signal that capture is over.
  - Image-done message is posted by camerabin2
    Camerabin2 is the element to post the image-done message, not the camera
    source.
  - Remove unused variables warnings in CheeseCamera
  - Split setting of CheeseCamera caps from playing
    Add new cheese_camera_set_new_caps() method, split from
    cheese_camera_play().
  - Set ClutterTextureVideoSink sync=false
    Without this the sink will issue a warning:

  ** (cheese:21655): WARNING **: Internal data flow problem.:
    gstbasesink.c(3626): gst_base_sink_chain_unlocked ():
  /GstCameraBin2:camerabin2/GstViewfinderBin:vf-bin/ClutterGstVideoSink:cluttergstvideosink0:
    Received buffer without a new-segment. Assuming timestamps start from 0.

    I'm not sure what the implications of this setting are. It might be
    caused by the clock/time rewriting magic from camerabin2.
  - Do not switch mode when stopping video recording
  - Set the video resolution
    Use the viewfinder-caps property of camerabin2, rather than the
    set-video-resolution-fps signal of camerabin.
  - Fix pixbuf-only capture
    camerabin2 sends the preview-image bus message through the
    gstwrappercamerabinsrc.

    In camerabin2 if the location is NULL, it is interpreted as a "don't
    write in a file just post the buffer as a bus message".
  - Enable post-preview property when needed
    When taking a photo to pixbuf, sets post-preview to enable camerabin2 to
    send the preview message.
  - Remove camerabin workaround
    No longer needed with camerabin2.
  - Convert image-done to a bus message, from a signal
    Quote from camerabin2's PORTING guide:

    In camerabin, image-done is a signal, in camerabin2, it is a bus message

  - Use definitions of MODE_IMAGE/VIDEO from camerabin
   #ifndef GST_USE_UNSTABLE_API
   #warning "camerabin enums are unstable API and may change in future."
   #warning "You can define GST_USE_UNSTABLE_API to avoid this warning."
   #endif
  - Handle photo/video moved to monitored directories
    Camerabin2 creates a temporary file, writes data to it and in the end it
    moves it to the destination path.

    Without G_FILE_MONITOR_SEND_MOVED to g_file_monitor_directory, moves
    would be sent as DELETE + CREATE.

    Unfortunately, we would also get CREATE events when the temporary file
    was created. We cannot listen for CREATE events as temporary files would
    be CREATEd and then CHANGEd and the thumb-view creation code would work
    with bad data.

    By using G_FILE_MONITOR_SEND_MOVED we get a single event when the file
    is moved. As the file monitor ignores files with unknown extensions (as
    is the case for the temporary files created by camerabin2) we could only
    just append the new file. But because the user might also move a
    picture/video manually from the Pictures/Webcam or Videos/Webcam
    directories, removing the old file from the thumb-view keeps it
    up-to-date with the state of the file system.

    If camerabin2 switches away from the create-temp+move approach, to the
    camerabin one (create the destination file directly), we're prepared
    to handle that code with G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_CHANGES_DONE_HINT.
  - Rename filename and capture-start/stop
    Quote from camerabin2's PORTING guide:

[...] is now called 'location' instead of 'filename'

    The signals were renamed from capture-start/stop to start/stop-capture
    as this is the usual naming on actions.
  - Video filter on camera_source applies to all modes
    If the effect is applied on camera_source, the effect will be available
    in viewfinder and image/video capture modes.
  - Minimal functionality based on camerabin2
    These are the minimal changes needed to integrate camerabin2.

    Support for:
      - viewfinder (Cheese's main window)
      - effect previews

    Porting details:
      - obviously, the name has changed to camerabin2
      - Camerabin2 requires something special from it's "camera-source".

    We use the "wrappercamerabinsrc" module provided by camerabin2 which
    creates a "camera-source" suitable for camerabin2 based on a regular
    video source.
  - Depend on GTK+ 3.4.4 for GtkIconView changes
  - Request correct number of thumbview columns
    Rather then assuming 5000 will be enough, just set the number of columns
    to the number of thumbnails in the view. Fixes bug 634958 and bug 678446.

  - Ensure width is a multiple of 8, and height of 2
    We ask GStreamer to use an YUV format in the pipeline, by setting the
    camerabin's "filter-caps" to "video/x-raw-yuv", and GStreamer demands of
    YUV format frames that their width is a multiple of 8, and their height
    a multiple of 2.

  - Fix cheese_camera_device_update_format_table loop
    Some devices report a very small min_width / height down to reporting
    0x0 as minimum resolution, which causes an infinite loop in
    cheese_camera_device_update_format_table().

    This patch limits the minimum resultion to 160x120, both to fix the
    infinite loop issue, and to remove ridiculous resolutions such as 2x2,
    5x3, 11x7, 22x15 etc. which are seen in the resolution drop down on some
    devices.

    For more details on the infinite loop issue, see:

version 3.5.3
  - Add border to capture page of preferences dialog
  - Add accelerators to menu items
  - Make the preferences dialog work again
    Move the Cheese.Camera to Cheese.Main and use the same camera in
    Cheese.MainWindow and Cheese.PreferencesDialog. Setup the Camera in
    Cheese.Main.
  - Enable handling of the shoot action
  - Enable effects state change action
  - Enable handling of the fullscreen action
  - Set photo button text based on mode state
  - Make preferences and mode actions application-wide
    Move PreferencesDialog from MainWindow to Main. Handle app.mode action
    changes and update the state accordingly.
  - Add David King to authors in about dialog
  - Start porting to application-wide GMenu
    Add a menu to the application, and enable application-wide actions for
    showing the help, showing the about dialog and quitting the application.
    Move the GtkBuilder definition of the about dialog into Cheese.Main.
  - Update TODO
    Remove some completed TODO items.
  - Use a realtime preset for video encoder element
    Use the ‘Profile Realtime’ preset for vp8enc to set reasonable defaults
    for realtime encoding. The preset was added in gst-plugins-bad 0.10.23,
    so fall back to reasonable defaults. Fixes bug 668560 and partially
    fixes bug 674779.
  - Do not add 0-sized files to the thumb view
    Sometimes, ie when Cheese crashes when starting to record, something which
    we need to fix, 0 bytes large files are created under ~/Videos/Webcam.

    totem-video-thumbnailer does not like these, getting stuck for around a
    minute on them, I have filed bug 677734 for this.

    But even with this bug fixed, trying to add 0 byte sized files to the
    thumb view makes no sense, and in the mean time it also neatly works
    around this totem-video-thumbnailer bug.

    Fixes bug 677735.
  - Do not overwrite camerabin's default flags
    The comment above this code said: "Set flags to enable conversions", but
    camerabin has conversion enabled in the necessary places by default, all
    the code does is add an extra, unneeded ffmpegcsp element at the
    beginning of the pipeline.

    This results in a huge number of reported caps on pads further down the
    pipeline, which when intersected with input caps of later ffmpegcsp
    elements leads to an explosion of possible combinations and
    gst_caps_intersect_full starts consuming the CPU for 100% for seconds
    (various Fedora users have reported startup delays of upto a minute).

    On my test system, with a Logitech Webcam 9000 Pro, the time to create
    the camerabin pipeline (not start, not configure, just create!) drops
    from 7 seconds to 0.7 seconds by elimenating the unnecessary ffmpegcsp
    element at the beginning of the pipe.

    The only reason the ffmpegcsp element this patch removes could be useful
    would be for cameras producing only JPEG data, but since Cheese always
    uses v4l2src, and that should always be compiled with libv4l2 support
    (otherwise a lot of camera specific video formats will not be
    understood), libv4l2 will take care of JPEG decompression, so there
    really is no reason for having this extra element, and thus no reason to
    override the default camerabin flags.

    Fixes bug 677731.

  - Add libcheese headers to GIR source files
  - Fix images missing from effect buttons
    Commit 4cb11731e62b51c684993e43000c933ea97785c2 fixed the images missing
    from the photo / video / burst buttons, but the same problem also
    affects the previous effects-page, effects, next effects-page buttons.
    This patch fixes them too.

    Note that unlike the commit message of commit 4cb11731 suggest this
    not only fixes the printing of warnings to the console, it also fixes
    the pixmaps actually missing from the buttons. Fixes bug 677543.
  - Do not add NULL devices to the camera list
    cheese_camera_device_monitor_set_up_device() will return NULL for non
    video devices (ie vbi & radio devices). Emitting the added signal with
    such a NULL device, causes it to get added to the camera list, which
    later on causes cheese to crash.

    This patch fixes this by not emitting the added signal for non camera
    devices. Fixes bug 677574.

    Setting "use-action-appearance" to False before setting the

  - Avoid overwriting errors in CheeseCamera
    As pointed out by Bastien Nocera in bug 671902, CheeseCamera overwrites
    GError pointers. Avoid this by setting the error and returning
    immediately afterwards.
  - Move variable declarations before code in C source
    This allows compilation to succeed with
    ‘-Wdeclaration-after-statement -Werror=declaration-after-statement’
    passed to GCC.
  - Handle smooth scroll wheel events in EogThumbNav

    the main loop. Stops warnings like this on exit:

    Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_main_quit: assertion `main_loops != NULL' failed

    which occur with GTK+ versions 3.3.4 or greater, when GtkApplication was

    The photo path was used for deleting videos, which would fail if the
    paths were different.
  - Install catalog instead of individual package
    Replaced hardcoding the nautilus-sendto package name in the code for
    runtime installation. Instead, a catalog (cheese.catalog) is used.

    when an user tries to open the Preferences dialog again what appears is
    an empty/tiny window. Handle the "delete-event" connecting it with
    hide_on_delete() successfully solved the problem.

    some further reasoning.
  - Disambiguate GLib.DBus in Cheese.Window
  - Use PackageKit for nautilus-sendto dependency

  - Fix Slovenian help translation
    The incorrect closing tag caused a build failure, reported by Luca
    Bruno.

    version after a release. As requested by Frédéric Péters.
  - Keep generating thumbnails for Theora videos
  - Check for VP8/WebM codecs during configure

  - Fix configure check for Xtst
  - Adapt to use new cheese_init and cheese_gtk_init
    Additionally, use EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE when exiting.
  - Add init functions to libcheese and libcheese-gtk

    confusion for API users, as well as reducing link-time dependencies.
    Provides a clean fix for bug 668292 and bug 667884.
  - Check nautilus-sendto dependency in configure
    Check whether nautilus-sendto is installed in the configure script. This
    is only required in order to use the sharing functionality, so a warning
    is presented if nautilus-sendto is not found.
    Fixes bug 668072.
  - Mimic Nautilus' behaviour when deleting files
    Show one dialog to ask for confirmation of operation. For each error
    show a dialog and allow to skip all errors, skip this error or stop
    deleting using Cancel.

    g_strjoin(G_DIR_SEPARATOR_S, ...).
  - Improve CheeseCamera documentation
    Document most of the private methods in CheeseCamera, and rename the
    device-name property to device-node.
  - Improve CheeseCameraDevice documentation
    Document most of the private methods in CheeseCameraDevice, and rename
    some variables to more closely match the property names.
  - Improve CheeseCameraDeviceMonitor documentation
  - Make CheeseFlash a GtkWindow rather than a GObject
    Additionally, add further gtk-doc-like comments to the flash
    implementation.
  - Comment Vala methods with Valadoc markup
    Add basic documentation to all methods in Vala sources.
  - Add hotplug support to preferences dialog
    Adding and removing camera devices in the CheeseCamera is now propagated
    to the preferences dialog UI. Partially fixes bug 603612.
  - Correct default brightness in the schema to zero
  - Improve GSettings schema text and include ranges
  - Also use the countdown duration for burst mode
  - Add a countdown-duration key to GSettings schema
    Add a new GSettings key to allow configuration of the duration of the
    countdown when taking a photo. Partially fixes bug 594267.
  - Bump required Vala version to 0.13.2
    Required for Clutter.TableLayout in clutter-1.0.vapi, which was added
    when Vala switched to use GIR files.
  - Use STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER
  - Use Vala ‘as’ operator where possible
    Use the as operator when fetching widgets from GtkBuilder files, to do a
    runtime type-check.
  - Include the version in the man page
  - Add generated man page to CLEANFILES
  - Fix a typo so that the man page is generated
  - Fix gtk-doc checks when srcdir != builddir
  - Add man page, generated with xsltproc
  - Add help button to the preferences dialog
  - Improve documentation to pass gtk-doc tests
    Add the deprecated API index to the documentation. Complete the rename
    of cheese_camera_set_device_by_dev_file() to
    cheese_camera_set_device_by_device_node(). Add missing documentation to
    reach 100% symbol coverage.
  - Enable gtk-doc tests during make check
  - Check for GStreamer plugins required at runtime
    Add a GStreamer plugin check to configure.ac, which checks for
    individual plugins with gst-inspect, rather than relying on the plugins
    being provided by checking for GStreamer pkg-config files. The check is
    non-fatal, as the plugins are not build-time dependencies.
  - Bump pkg-config requirement to 0.24
    Version 0.24 or greater of pkg-config is required in order to avoid the
    duplicate AC_SUBST macro calls for PKG_CHECK_MODULES substitutions.
  - Remove unused FULL_LIBEXECDIR from configure.ac
  - Add private pointers to libcheese GObject structs
    Speed up access to the private struct of the GObject by adding a
    pointer, so that *_GET_PRIVATE does not have to called each time. Create
    a typedef for the private structures in the headers, and hide the
    structs from the documentation by placing them inside a private
    subsection.
  - Add basic documentation for remaining public API
    Add cheese-widget-private.h back to files ignored by gtk-doc. Add basic
    documentation for the remainder of the public API. Use UUID instead of
    ID or UDI. Add blurb and nick to all documented properties. Add
    CheeseVideoFormat documentation. Use unsigned integers where the values
    are always positive. Sprinkle some const qualifiers. Add some filename
    GObject Introspection annotations.
  - Update TODO
  - Fix several compiler warnings
    Add some missing prototypes, correct some pointer type mismatches, return
    a value from functions that returns values and improve GError handling.
  - Use gnome-common compiler warnings
    Additionally, enable silent Automake rules by default so that warnings are
    more visible.
  - Add more classes to gtk-doc documentation
    Add basic documentation for CheeseCamera, CheeseFileUtil and CheeseFlash
    classes. Split the API reference into libcheese and libcheese-gtk
    chapters.
  - Add CheeseCameraDeviceMonitor::removed callback
    Added CheeseCameraDeviceMonitor::removed signal callback function in
    CheeseCamera. Fixes bug 662852.
  - Improved CheeseCameraDeviceMonitor::added signal
    CheeseCameraDeviceMonitor:added has now a CheeseCameraDevice argument.
    CheeseCameraDeviceMonitor is also now a member of CheeseCamera.
  - Add a long description to the DOAP file
  - help: fixed another typo
  - help: moving introduction page back to .page
  - help: fixed typo in Makefile.am
  - help: updated Makefile.am
  - Overhaul the libcheese documentation
    Add documentation for CheeseCameraDevice. Remove bogus XML included in
    the library overview. Add section documentation to all classes, and mark
    them as unstable. Add GObject and GObjectClass struct documentation.
  - help: renamed pages and rearranged sections
    Moved all pages, except introduction.page, into sections to make index
    look nicer.
  - Use license-type in the about dialog
  - Connect thumbnail nav button signals
    The thumb nav widget crashed when clicking the buttons to scroll the
    thumbnail view. This was caused by connecting to the wrong signals:
    ‘button-pressed-event’ and ‘button-released-event’, rather than
    ‘pressed’ and ‘released’. There was also some duplicate code for
    creating the left button, which led to a GtkButton being leaked when
    the thumb nav was created. Fixes bug 660686.
  - Remove obsolete MAINTAINERS file
    http://live.gnome.org/Git/FAQ#How_do_I_add_a_description_to_the_git_web_view.3F__What_is_this_.22blah.doap.22.3F
  - Remove obsolote cicl script
  - Increase the photo count in burst mode to 100000
    Fixes bug 659977
  - Use an idle handler to generate thumbnails
    A thread was used for generating thumbnails for CheeseThumbView, but
    this had problems with concurrent access to the GtkListStore which
    backs the thumb view, as in bug 648936. A simpler approach is to use an
    idle handler, which avoids the need for acquiring the GDK lock.

    661651.
  - Prefer a dark GTK+ theme, bug 660628
  - Do not crash if gnome-video-effects is not present
    Also, print a warning using warning(). Fixes bug 654671.
  - Add David King as a maintainer
  - Do not call _init() functions inside CheeseWidget
    GObject construction cannot fail, which is incompatible with calling
    _init() functions which can fail inside a constructor. Users of
    CheeseWidget must instead initialise the relevant toolkits (Clutter-GTK+
    and Gst-Clutter) themselves, and gracefully fail before
    cheese_widget_new() is called. Fixes the remainder of bug 654913 and
    also bug 660400.

  - about: Update credits according to AUTHORS file
  - cheese-camera: Print debug of messages
  - thumb-view: start monitoring at startup
    Before this we started monitoring each for each photo/video
    capture. That was a bit inefficient as the directories in which photos
    and videos are saved are known and don't change during the program's
    lifetime.
    Now we start the monitoring at startup only once.
  - cheese-camera: make effect previews scale with the cheese window
    Before this patch, when you scaled Cheese's main window, in the the
    effects preview mode, the window would scale but the 9 videos inside
    the window would remain at the same size.
    I had to remove the fixed scaling from the effects pipeline and let
    the size of the textures be governed by the layout manager.
    Now when you scale the Cheese effect preview window all 9 videos are
    automatically scaled (keeping aspect-ratio) to fill the available space.
  - libcheese: aligned button to center
  - add gio-2.0 and x11 to PKG_CHECK_MODULES
  - cheese-gtk.pc: Update 'requires private' to gtk3
  - window: use the right signature for button-release-event callback
    The signature is (ClutterActor, ClutterEvent). Using the event source
    there is wrong, as that's not guaranteed to be the same object emitting
    the callback (i.e. the object emitting could be just forwarding an event
    coming from one of its children).

version 2.91.91.1
  - Drop version to 2.91.91.1
    The tarball release of 2.91.91 was generated with a tarball release of
    Vala that was affected by bug 642885. This is a point release, that
    contains a workaround for that bug until a new Vala release (0.11.7) is
    out.

  - Correct some configure requirements

version 2.91.91
  - use camerabin for taking photos and videos
  - Migrated from libunique to GtkApplication
  - Ported to GTK+ 3.x
  - build: Update autotools configuration
  - cheese-camera: Unsetting preview-caps after photo
    After taking a photo to pixbuf, we set preview-caps to NULL so regular
    photo doesn't send the preview message.
  - cheese-camera: Fixing take_photo_pixbuf
    Method cheese_camera_take_photo_pixbuf was not working. Now it is
    implemented using camerabin's features. We set preview-caps in camerabin
    and get the buffer for the photo via message on the bus.
    Signals are now only emitted if the capture was successful.
  - cheese-camera: Set video recording options
    Set encoding and multiplexing options.
  - svg overlay effects can now be added
  - cheese-camera: Set filter-caps property
    Set filter-caps property to avoid camerabin default of video/x-raw-yuv
    format=(fourcc)I420.
  - cheese-camera: Enabling source color conversion
    Setting the flag to enable color conversion on video source. Flags names
    were also redefined to allow code readability.
  - cheese-camera: Setting resolution in camerabin
    Cheese was using a capsfilter after video source to configure the
    desired resolution for pictures and video. We now use the camerabin
    signal set-video-resolution-fps to set desired resolution.
  - cheese-camera: Removing height and width defaults
    Camerabin has video-capture defaults that can cause not-negotiated
    errors or set resolution to values that are not the requested by the
    user. Setting them to zero we allow the resolution to be negotiated.
  - cheese-camera: Creating a separate effects_preview_bin
    Create a effects_preview_bin that will hold all elements related to
    effects live preview. This bin is added to video_filter_bin, the same
    bin that contained those elements directly before.
  - cheese-camera: Use camerabin as pipeline base
    Changed Cheese-Camera to use camerabin as its base. Camerabin implements
    view-finder, image capture and video recording.
  - Add gobject introspection support to build system
  - configure.ac: Changing required versions
    Cheese works with older version of clutter, gtk, gdk and
    libgnomedesktop.
  - cheese-window: Fix vala syntax problem
    Cheese wasn't compiled by latest java because of this array
    construction. Changing it to a proper array we avoid the compiling
    problem. Fixes bug #639276.

  - bump LT_VERSION numbers for libcheese and libcheese-gtk
  - Splitting dependencies of libcheese and libcheese-gtk
    Spliting dependencies of libcheese and libcheese-gtk and linking
    libcheese library with it's dependencies.
  - libcheese: Removing unnecessary includes
    Removing unnecessary includes of gtk in libcheese modules.
  - Creating pkgconfig file for libcheese and libcheese-gtk
  - Adding test for CheeseCamera
    cheese-test-camera creates a CheeseCamera and takes a photo that will be
    saved in testcamera.jpg after five seconds.
  - Creating libcheese, installable non-gtk lib
    Cheese-flash is now part of libcheese-gtk, since it depends on gtk and
    we want libcheese to not depend on it. Libcheesecommon is now called
    simply Libcheese and it's installed, it's the main cheese lib which can
    be used to set the pipeline, take_photos and record video.
  - remove countdown from libcheese
    cheese uses the new countdown in src/cheese-countdown.vala
    which prints the countdown directly on the clutter texture.
  - cheese-test-chooser: Use gtk_clutter_init
    Cheese test chooser should use gtk_clutter_init instead of gtk_init,
    since cheese-camera now uses a ClutterTexture to display video.
  - cheese-camera: using const char * when appropriate
    Filenames and other string parameters used to set properties can be
    const.
  - cheese-camera: switch_device is now a void method
    Method cheese_camera_switch_device always returned true. Its return
    value can be ignored.
  - cheese-camera: Making methods static
    Some methods are only used inside CheeseCamera, so I removed them from
    header file and declared them as static.
  - cheese-widget: Fix return type for get_settings
  - remove dbus support from cheese, fixes bug #622915
  - cheese-camera: Check return of linking effect
    Return if linking effect preview was not successful.
  - cheese-camera: Removing extra colorspace after effect
    Effects are already created using one colorspace before and one after
    its pipeline description, so there is no need to add another colorspace
    after the effect bin.
  - cheese-camera: Handle more bus messages
    When bus receives error or warning messages, we parse them and print
    warning messages.

  - do a fade in animatin on each new effect page
  - calculate the dimension of the effect previews automatically
    this is done by getting the viewport dimension, subtracting
    the borders and then dividing by three. if there are less than
    9 effects on the last effects pane, we want to still start
    putting the previews in the upper left corner. in fullscreen
    we simply use the same size.
  - remove useless comments
  - align the effects in the center, regardless of window size

version 2.91.2
  - port cheese to gsettings
    this commit drops gconf entirely from cheese and uses
    gsettings. glib and gio dependency was bumped to 2.26.0
  - Increased upper bound for number of photos taken in burst mode and time
    interval between photos taken in burst mode
  - Removed mx dependency. Bumped minimum clutter version to 1.4.0
  - test-widget: Using gtk_clutter_init
    The test cheese-test-widget was using gtk_init instead of
    gtk_clutter_init, displaying the error "Unable to create a new stage".
  - widget: Using ClutterTexture instead of DrawingArea
    The method cheese_camera_new expects a ClutterTexture, but the widget
    was trying to use a GtkDrawingArea. It now has a GtkClutterEmbed widget
    that contains a ClutterTexture that will be used by cheese_camera_new.
  - camera: emit video-saved signal by name in gst threads
    Static camera_signals array is not initizialized in the gstreamer thread
    so we get a critical assertion failed (signal_id > 0) if we emit by id.
    This should workaround the issue #620637
  - Mapped the Escape key to either stop a current action or to take you out of
    the effects selector or fullscreen
  - main: properly start GtkClutter to avoid a runtime warning
    Initializing GtkClutter instead of gtk and clutter separately
    prevents this:
    ClutterGLX-CRITICAL **: Unable to make the stage window 0x4600035 the current GLX drawable
  - Fixed bug where you can start multiple countdowns in photo mode that
    run together and mess up the counter
  - json: fix a boolean property defined as a string
    Fixes a g_value_copy incompatible types critical warning at runtime
  - configure: Use cheese instead of Cheese
    This way the .ui files are installed in /usr/shared/cheese
    as expected, instead of /usr/shared/Cheese, fixes bug #626697
  - check if vala is available, fail if not, partially fixes #626697
  - bump vala requirement to 0.9.2 and use the new syntax for gtk stock items
    in vala 0.10
  - add identity effect manually at the first position of the effect list
  - remove --verbose command line flag, log handler and bugreport script
    as most of the debug output is done with GST_* or with
    debug() and message(), the log file is useless and therefore
    the bugreport script which is collection that file too.
  - show the version with the -v/--version command line flag
  - check if device uri is null, before setting up the camera with it
  - add a command line option to specify camera file, fixes bug #614778
    the -d or --device option was added to specify a different
    device file. if the device file does not exist, or is not a
    valid v4l/v4l2 device it will be silently ignored
  - bump libcanberra version requirement to 0.23
  - play a sound when taking a photo
    this was somehow not added when we did the vala port, now
    everybody can enjoy that lovely shutter sound
  - parse our custom gtkrc file to hide the thumbview arrows
  - Killed several memory leaks
  - Fixed some runtime warnings
  - Camera related actions are now disabled until the pipeline is playing
  - Show error dialogs when any of the file operations fail
  - Made app crash early if the GTKBUilder UI files are not found
  - get rid of eog thumbnail
    removed eog thumbnail and added cheese thumbnail, which
    uses the best things from nautilus and eog.
  - Display 'No effects found' message if no effects were found.
  - Removed most unneccessary warnings when compiling src/*
    Warnings that remain point to real problems that should be handled
  - Errors in effect files no longer fatal
  - Partially removed warnings that appeared during effect switching
  - use the correct protocol in licence dialog, fixes bug #610207
    as the original text of the link began with &lt;http://...
    this was seen as the protocol, however the protocol is just
    http://
  - Split UI setup into UI Setup and camera setup. Shows Window as soon
    as UI is setup.
    Slightly faster time-to-window-visible
  - ignore effects, if they are already loaded
    if an effect is already loaded, cheese ignores the effect
    and does not add it to the ui. this is done by comparing the
    gstreamer pipeline
  - load effects from ~/.local/share/gnome-video-effects/
    xdg user_data_dir defaults to ~/.local/share/gnome-video-effects,
    so we are looking into that place for user effects
  - Effect preview elements are now constructed on-demand, rather than
    at startup.
  - remove the effect files from cheese from now on and add gnome-video-effects
    as a dependency. effects are brought to the users home by the package
    gnome-video-effects (http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-video-effects).
    this way, many applications, like Pitivi or Empathy are able to use the
    same effects as we do. however, we will not depend on it, as it is an
    optional package and not needed to run.

    cheese looks for a directory named gnome-video-effects in one of the system
    share directories proposed by XDG (mostly /usr/share/ or /usr/local/share/).

    it also looks if the user has a directory named ~/.gnome-video-effects. we
    probably should change that and use the XDG standard for user shared files,
    which is ~/.local/share/
  - Removed a few unnecessary camera start/stops during startup
  - Do not create a device if gst initializazion fails
    Currently we create a device with empty caps if the probing pipeline
    cannot be started. That's wrong, the device evidendtly doesn't work so
    the CheeseCameraDevice object for doesn't have to be created. Fixes bug #618203

version 2.29.91
  * cheese:
    - Restore the infobar temporarily disabled in the previous version
    - Make the infobar display generic errors about camera
      initialization instead of just the "no-device" one.

  * libcheese-gtk:
    - Remove "ready" and "error" signals in CheeseWidget and use a
      "state" property to track current widget state (none, ready,
      error).
    - Add cheese_widget_get_error() api to retrieve a GError (propagated
      from CheeseCamera) if something failed (widget in error state).
    - Update CheeseAvatarChooser to reflect the new api.

  * Fixed bugs:

  * Export libcheese-gtk library
  * Rework Cheese itself to use libcheese-gtk

  * Fix a possible crasher and a hang in CheeseCamera
  * Require libgudev on Linux systems
  * Limit framerate to 30 frames per second

  * Updated German documentation

version 2.29.5

  A slightly different format for these release notes.
  We missed a couple of releases in the 2.29 cycle and the big changes
  cheese went through meanwhile deserves something better than a cold
  list of commit messages.
  Big thanks go to Bastien Nocera who took up most longstanding items
  in our TODO list and implemented them right away.
  So let's see what happened since 2.28. Note that most of the following
  stuff is still a work in progress so don't expect everything listed to
  be completed.

  * Completely dropped HAL dependency
    Port most HAL code for v4l capability probing into udev and use
    gudev in cheese to take advantage of it.
    Add infrastructure (CheeseCameraDeviceMonitor) for dynamic
    device hotplugging (UI yet to come).
    Add optional udev dependency and provide a simple entry point
    for non linux platforms that will want to use their custom
    detection code (still waiting for patches).

  * First steps in splitting cheese code into two libraries
    - libcheese-common
      Will provide basic non UI related cheese functions: basically,
      device detection, device monitoring, video format handling.
    - libcheese-gtk
      A set of widgets that will allow third party application to
      include parts of cheese functionality (e.g. the avatar chooser
      will soon embed a viewfinder for quickly shooting a nice
      buddy icon). Ideally cheese will be soon based on this set of
      widgets being the first user of our own library.

  * Rework most of device capability handling code
    Rewrite caps detection code trying to use gstreamer api instead of
    our own custom stuff whenever possible.
    Remove framerate retrieving code since we didn't use it since a
    couple of releases.

  * Make startup slightly faster
    Probe device capabilities in PAUSED state instead of PLAYING.
    This was actually a workaround for a now fixed gstreamer bug (See
    #587082).
    Just a two line change but cheese is notably faster now!

  * Cosmetic changes
    Remove all the fake webcam code and use a still error image when
    no webcam is available.
    Drop EphySpinner in favor of the new GtkSpinner. Invert colors to
    make it sexier.
    Remove actions (SendTo stuff) from the contextual menu. It wasn't
    exactly the best way to interoperate with the desktop. And most of
    them worked suboptimally anyway.

  * Move to GST_DEBUG (first steps, probably needs work)
    We use gstreamer anyway, why not to take full advantage of it?
    Gstreamer debug infrastructure is really cool and surely a lot
    better than our previous g_prints.

  * Fixed bugs
    #598902 — Make flash window a popup
    #594966 — Drop HAL
    #603595 — Add a photo-taken signal, which passes a pixbuf
    #522199 — First pass at webcam widget for use in other applications
    #598445 — Use GtkSpinner instead of our own
    #603152 — Use libcanberra instead of GStreamer for shutter
    #603161 — Make CheeseGConf a singleton object
    #603162 — Make CheeseFileUtil a singleton
    #603167 — Avoid warnings on exit when playback hasn't started
    #595005 — Use a custom filename to group burst mode pictures
    #596535 — String fixes

  - fix the abortion of burst mode with the escape key, fixes bug #595073
    burst mode can now be aborted with the Escape key, no matter if
    the countdown is active or not.
    when burst mode is running you could start it again with spacebar,
    this has been disabled during the burst session.

  - Restore default window size that was changed with the netbook-mode
    merge.
  - Prevent the thumbview to shrink down to nothing when there are no
    items. Keep track of current items number and set a size request when
    it reaches zero.
  - Remove a bunch of hacks used in wide-mode switching to keep the video
    area size constant. Do everything in a more proper, non hackish, way.
    Fixes window "flickering" when switching to Wide Mode.

version 2.27.90
  - Drop HILDON mode. We used to have HILDON support once but it has
    been broken for several major releases now. Better no support than
    a partial and broken one.

  - Merge netbook-mode branch. Introduces a new horizontal mode that
    fits nicely in small screens where the vertical real estate is
    limited (like netbooks). Commits summary follows.
  - Enable wide mode at startup if enabled in gconf or if forced
    through -w/--wide command line option. Save wide mode
    state in a gconf key.
  - Prevent icon view to shrink down when empty.
  - Let the thumbview pick up its optimal size. Remove hard coded size
    constraints for the icon view so that it picks up the best size
    for the current children (i.e. centered items, even with no
    selection, with every thumbnail size). Remove also extra
    spacing between and around thumbnails.
  - Correctly update thumbnav button sensitiveness. Force an update on
    up and down button sensitiveness while switching mode.
  - Keep size of the video preview area while switching mode. This way
    the icon view moves from the bottom to the right side while the
    rest of the window remains still.
  - Add UI for dynamically switching to and from wide mode.
    Add a WideMode action that triggers widget reparenting and changes
    spacing the vertical mode.
  - Add a function that sets the ThumbNav in vertical mode reparenting
    widgets on the fly.
  - Add a vertical mode for the ThumbNav. Add up and down buttons and
    implement vertical scrolling logic.
  - Reparent the icon view into the right aligment. First experiment
    of an horizontal mode suited for netbooks.
  - Make room for a vertical icon view in the right side. Add an hbox
    and an alignment to contain the icon view in the yet to come
    netbook mode.

  - Set WARNING MessageType for the InfoBar.
    Warning is certainly more suited since the missing webcam is not a fatal
    error. Also, the red color for the error type is really ugly. This
    lovely orange is much better.
  - Remove *.glade files.
    It is not recommended to use gtk-builder-convert anymore but to use
    glade-3 directly on the .ui files
  - Insensitize buttons and actions while "bursting".
  - Take the first photo of a burst right after button press. Rework a
    little bit burst mode to allow this.
  - Add 256x256 Cheese icons, courtesy of Ulisse Perusin.
  - Add tooltips to the buttons. Now that toolbar buttons have no
    labels tooltips can be helpful to identify each button role.
  - Add burst mode settings to preferences dialog. Allow to configure
    amount of photos to take in a burst and delay between each one.
  - Remove icon-size attribute of button icons. All icons have now the
    same size and honour gtk theme settings.
  - Add the scalable version of the take photo and burst icons.
  - Add --version command line flag.

  - post release version bump

  - remove the label of the photo and video modes
  - support taking a series of photos, fixes bug #581997
    this introduces the burst mode in cheese.
    the burst mode allows to take a series of photos
    with a configurable delay and number of photos
  - Make webcam and resolution settings not sensitive if just 1 option
    is available. If there are no options to choose, make the webcam and

version 2.27.4
  - bump gtk+ requirement to 2.17.3
  - ensure the drawing area has a native X11 window
    With the new client-side-window gtk+ widgets do not always have a
    native window anymore. We need an XID to give to GstXOverlay and embed
    video into the application. This temporarily works around the issue
    forcing a native window. Works around bug 588357
  - use the camera-web icon instead of camera-video
    we are using camera-web in the project logo/icon but camera-video for the
    UI. it is more appropriate to use the camera-web icon as it's a) less
    likely people will use camcorders with cheese b) there is bigger visual
    distinction between camera-photo and camera-web than camera-photo and
    camera-video.
  - manually expose the window if not PLAYING
    Draw a black background if the pipeline is starting up and the overlay
    is still not ready to expose the drawing area.
  - fix broken xoverlay management
    For some reason this went unnoticed for a long time. We were calling
    set_x_overlay right after setting PLAYING state (with no warranty that
    the state change succeeded nor that an overlay was really there). The
    only right way to do this is to wait for prepare-xwindow-id message. It
    worked until now just because we've been extremely lucky.
  - drop url and email handlers
    Drop url and email handlers used in the about dialog since gtk+ 2.17.2
    already provides that functionality built in.
  - drop GEditMessageArea in favor of GtkInfoBar
    Drop GEditMessageArea since it recently entered gtk+. Fixes bug #586545
  - use AM_SILENT_RULES if available, fixes bug #587581
  - Use accessor functions instead direct access, fixes bug #585210
  - remove markup from translatable strings
  - keybindings: add configure checks for needed X11 stuff
    Check for XF86keysym.h availability and add a configure option to
    disable Webcam Button listening. Copied from rhythmbox.
  - add little program to emit fake webcam button events
  - capture webcam buttons
    Listen to XF86Webcam keypresses to capture webcam buttons. Should
    work with every driver that correctly binds the input device to
    KEY_CAMERA events. Fixes bug #521551
  - remove padding from the take_picture button
    Use alignment xscale property instead of padding in the take_picture
    button. Doesn't fix but at least partly works around bug #573301 (the
    button can now grow up and fill the whole free space with no padding
    constraint).
  - sanitize main toolbar structure
    No real change, just some little restructuring of the glade toolbar
    definition to make it easier to hack on.

version 2.27.3
  - Set default resolution to the highest one with a non jerky (higher than
    15fps) framerate, fixes bug #585857
  - Lower max-delay and max-page-delay oggmux properties from 5 to 0.5
    seconds. Should prevent out of sync audio in recorded videos and
    hopefully fix bug #585761
  - Don't access effects string after free. This was causing the first effect
    stored in gconf to not be restored at startup, fixes bug 584186
  - Get rid of GtkAspectFrame, it doesn't really suit our needs, it hardcodes
    an aspect ratio that obviously cannot be valid for every format webcams
    support. Render the video directly to the drawing area with no external
    aspect ratio restriction. Eventually fixes bug #559188 since the
    aspectframe was adding some extra padding between the video and the window
    border.
  - Almost every available gstreamer videosink can display black bars around
    the video keeping its aspect ratio. Enable it if available.
    Black bars look a lot nicer than the grey color of the underlying
    gtkwindow displayed with the aspectframe.
  - Properly forward expose events to GstXOverlay.
  - Avoid ugly flickering on window resize. Let gstxoverlay take full control
    of the drawing area window. Prevent gtk from drawing the background and
    remove the flickering caused by its internal double buffering.
  - Remove initial black bars (at least for 4:3 webcams). Set a default window
    size that fits nicely the video aspect ratio so that black bars are not
    drawn until a manual resize.
